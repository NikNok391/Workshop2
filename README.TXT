Information about using the program.

- Because there are two lists, boat- and memberlist, and two datafiles, I used this design. 
- Both files start with the number of objects so in an empty list should there be at least a '0' (for zero objects)
- I was not sure where to place the "load" and "save" functions for the data so I decided to put the to the controller. So the repository remains as a pure storage without any complex functionallity.
- I was also not sure about the Strings used in the controller but there is now no final describing string, all strings which are used in the controller are "just-in-time".
